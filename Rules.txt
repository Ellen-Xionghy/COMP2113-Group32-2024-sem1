************START GAME************
To start this game, you have four choices:
1.  You can start a new game by entering "1"
2.  If you want to see the previous winner list, type"2"
3.  If you want to read the rules, type "3"
4.  If you want to quit the game, type "4"

************GAME SET UP************

1.  When you start a new game,
you should first input the number of players.

Remind: this number should be 2-4,
out of this range will receive a warning 
and you should input a number again 
until this number is valid.

2.  Next, input the name of players by order.

Remind: the name should be non-empty and distinct
else, you should input players' names again 
until the names are valid.

3.  Then you can see the map and players' name
there are all kinds of squares on the map.
Here to explain what different types of squares represent:
		1)  "#" represents a normal square.
			No special effects.
		2)  "+" represent lucky square.
			When the player moves to it,
			there will be a bonus for the player.
			This bonus is a random integer of 1 to 10,
			the player will move "bonus" steps forward.
		3)  "@" represents an unlucky square.
			When the player moves to it,
			there will be a penalty for the player.
			This penalty is a random integer from 1 to 3,
			the player will move "penalty" steps back.
		4)  "*" represents a pause square.
			When the player moves to it 
			the player should pause for one round 
			and can move next round
		5)  "%" represents a swap square.
			When the player moves to it,
			the player will switch the position
			with another random player.
		6) If there are more than one player staying at the 
			square, we will use "&" to represent them.
		7) If there is only one player staying at the square,
			we will use the player index to represent it.

************GAMING PROCESS************

1.  At first, every player is in the first square.

2.  Then, every player rolls dice in order.
	You should type "c" to roll the dice or 
	to type "q" to quit the game. Other input 
	will be considered invalid, and you will need to 
	input it again.
	
3. Next, you can see how many steps you will move
	and you can see your move on the map.
	Then the next player will roll the dice.

4.  Interestingly, when a player moves to a position
	that another player stays in, the player who arrives 
	here first will move back 3 squares.

5.  When a player is near the destination, for example, 
	3 spaces to the destination, 
	the player must roll 3 to get to the destination
	otherwise, the player will move back. If the dice is 5,
	the position will be 2 spaces to the destination

************FINISHING GAME************

1.  When a player arrives at the destination, 
	the game will end in that round.
2.  The winner will be recorded and stored

That is all about this game. I hope you enjoy it.
